I've uploaded a SQL query file that includes advanced queries for analyzing election results. The queries perform tasks such as calculating total seats won by alliances (NDA, I.N.D.I.A.), identifying party performance by state, and uncovering regional trends. This file is part of a comprehensive election data analysis project using datasets like partywise results and constituency-wise details.
